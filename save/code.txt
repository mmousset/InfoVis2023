Given your CSV columns, you can handle the data efficiently by focusing on the relevant columns for your visualizations. For the bar chart, you would need the `experience_level` column. For the salary distribution graph, you would need the `experience_level` and `salary_in_usd` columns.

Here's how you can modify the previous D3.js code to handle your specific CSV data:

```javascript
d3.csv("yourfile.csv").then(function(data) {
    // Convert columns to appropriate types
    data.forEach(function(d) {
        d.salary_in_usd = +d.salary_in_usd; // convert string to number
    });

    // For the bar chart, you can use d3.nest() to group data by experience_level
    let experienceData = d3.nest()
        .key(function(d) { return d.experience_level; })
        .rollup(function(v) { return v.length; }) // count number of people per experience level
        .entries(data);

    // For the salary distribution graph, you can filter data based on clicked experience level
    let salaryData = data.filter(function(d) { return d.experience_level === clickedExperienceLevel; });

    // Rest of the code to create the graphs
});
```

In this code, `d3.nest()` is used to group your data by `experience_level` and count the number of people for each experience level. This will be used for the x and y axes of your bar chart. When a bar is clicked, the `experience_level` of the clicked bar is used to filter your data for the salary distribution graph.

Remember to replace `"yourfile.csv"` with the actual path to your CSV file. This is a simplified example and you might need to adjust the code based on your specific requirements and data structure. Also, don't forget to include error handling in your code. Let me know if you have any questions.


For the bar chart, you can use d3.scaleBand() for the x-axis (work experience) and d3.scaleLinear() for the y-axis (number of people).
let x = d3.scaleBand().range([0, width]).padding(0.1);
let y = d3.scaleLinear().range([height, 0]);

x.domain(data.map(function(d) { return d.workExperience; }));
y.domain([0, d3.max(data, function(d) { return d.numPeople; })]);

You can then create the bars for the bar chart and add an onclick event listener to each bar. When a bar is clicked, you can update the second graph.
svg.selectAll(".bar")
    .data(data)
    .enter().append("rect")
    .attr("class", "bar")
    .attr("x", function(d) { return x(d.workExperience); })
    .attr("width", x.bandwidth())
    .attr("y", function(d) { return y(d.numPeople); })
    .attr("height", function(d) { return height - y(d.numPeople); })
    .on("click", function(d) {
        // code to update the second graph based on the clicked work experience
    });


For the second graph showing the salary distribution, you can use a similar approach but you would need to filter the data based on the clicked work experience.
let filteredData = data.filter(function(d) { return d.workExperience === clickedWorkExperience; });

// code to create the second graph using filteredData
